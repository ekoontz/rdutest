# rdutest

A simple test framework

## Usage

user=> (load "rdutest")
user=> (ns user (:use [rdutest]))

simplest passing test:

  (rdutest "trivial pass" true (fn [result] (= result true)) :trivial-pass)

simplest failing test:

  (rdutest "trivial fail" true (fn [result] (= result false)) :trivial-fail)

a bit less simple usage:
  (rdutest "addition" (+ 1 3) (fn [result] (= result 4)) :addition)
 
arguments:
  1. string to be printed for humans
  2. test to be run
  3. function to apply to result of 2.
  4. key (redundant with 1; needs to be removed.)

running tests repeatedly:

  (repeatedly 3 #(rdutest "trivial pass" true (fn [result] (= result true)) :trivial-pass))
